<h1>🚀 Unit 1: Laws of Motion</h1>

<div class="section">
<div class="heading">The Basics: Mechanics</div>

<p><span class="sub">Statics:</span> Study of bodies at rest. 📌</p>
<p><span class="sub">Dynamics:</span> Study of moving bodies. 📌</p>
<p><span class="sub">Kinematics:</span> Motion without considering the cause (force).</p>
<p><span class="sub">Kinetics:</span> Motion considering the cause (force).</p>

<p><span class="sub">Galileo:</span> Proposed that the natural state can be rest or uniform motion. Stated that in a vacuum, all bodies fall at the same rate regardless of mass.</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">Inertia: The "Lazy" Property 😴</div>

<p><span class="sub">Definition:</span> The inherent property of a body to resist any change in its state of rest or motion.</p>

<p><span class="sub">Inertia of Rest:</span> Resistance to moving (e.g., a coin falls into a glass when the cardboard under it is flicked).</p>

<p><span class="sub">Inertia of Motion:</span> Resistance to stopping (e.g., an athlete runs before jumping to get a longer leap).</p>

<p><span class="sub">Inertia of Direction:</span> Resistance to changing path (e.g., leaning sideways when a car takes a sharp turn).</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">Linear Momentum (p) 🏃💨</div>

<p><span class="sub">Definition:</span> The impact of a force is determined by both the mass and the velocity of a body. To quantify this impact exactly, we use Linear Momentum. It is defined as the product of mass and velocity of a moving body.</p>

<p><span class="sub">Nature:</span> It is a Vector Quantity (it has both magnitude and direction).</p>

<p><span class="sub">Direction:</span> It always acts in the direction of the velocity of the object.</p>

<p><span class="sub">Purpose:</span> It helps to measure the magnitude of a force.</p>

<div class="formula">Formula: p = m x v (Mass × Velocity).</div>

<p><span class="sub">Unit:</span> kg m s-¹ (SI) or g cm s-1 (CGS).</p>

<p><span class="sub">Nature:</span> Vector quantity (has direction).</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">Force</div>

<p><span class="sub">Force:</span> An external effort (push or pull) that: Starts motion in a static body, Stops a moving body, Changes the direction of a moving body.</p>

<p><span class="sub">Types of Forces:</span></p>

<p><b>Resultant Force:</b> The single combined effect of several forces acting on a body. It is the vector sum of all forces.</p>

<p><b>Balanced Forces:</b> When the resultant force is zero (the body stays in equilibrium).</p>

<p><b>Unbalanced Forces:</b> When the resultant force is not zero (causes motion).</p>

<p><b>Equilibrant:</b> A force equal to the resultant force in magnitude but opposite in direction, used to bring a system to equilibrium.</p>

<p><span class="sub">Nature:</span> Vector quantity (has both magnitude and direction).</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">Newton’s Three Laws of Motion 🍎</div>

<p><b>1st Law (Law of Inertia):</b> Defines Force and Inertia. A body stays at rest/motion unless a force acts on it.  every body continues to be in its state of rest or the state of uniform motion along a straight line unless it is acted upon by some external force.</p>

<p><b>2nd Law (Law of Force):</b> “the force acting on a body is directly proportional to the rate of change of linear momentum of the body and the change in momentum takes place in the direction of the force”.     Force = mass x acceleration (F = ma).</p>

<p><b>3rd Law:</b> ‘for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. They always act on two different bodies’. F(B) = -F(A)</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">Important Units of Force</div>

<p><b><span class="subtitle">SI:</b></span> Newton (N).</p>
<p><b><span class="subtitle">CGS:</b></span> dyne.</p>

<div class="formula">Conversion: 1N = 10 ^ 5 dyne.</div>

<p><b><span class="subtitle">Gravitational Unit:</b></span> In the SI system of units, gravitational unit of force is kilogram force, represented by kg f. In the CGS system its unit is gram force, represented by g f.                          1 kgf = 1 kg x 9.8 ms ^ (-2) = 9.8 N;</p>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">Moments, Torque, and Couples 🎡</div>

<p><b><span class="subtitle">Torque (Moment of Force):</b></span> (Moment of Force): The turning effect of a force about a fixed point or axis.</p>
<div class="formula">Formula: Torque = Force x distance (T = F x d).</div>

<p><b><span class="subtitle">Couple:</b></span> Two equal and opposite forces acting together to rotate something (like a car steering wheel).</p>

<div class="formula">Moment of a Couple: M = F * S (Force * perpendicular distance between the two forces).</div>

<p><b><span class="subtitle">Principle of Moments:</b></span> At equilibrium, Clockwise Moment = Anticlockwise Moment (F₁d₁ = F2d2).</p>
<p><span class="subtitle">Rule:</span> Clockwise moments are Negative (-); Anticlockwise moments are Positive (+).</p>


</div>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">Impulse (J) ⚡</div>

<p><b><span class="subtitle">Definition:</b></span> A huge force acting for a very short interval of time.</p>
<p><b><span class="subtitle">Example:</b></span> A cricket player pulling his hand back while catching. This increases the time to reduce the force (less pain).</p>

<div class="formula">Formula: Impulse = Force x time (J = F x t).</div>

<p><b><span class="subtitle">Law of Conservation of Linear Momentum:</b></span> In the absence of an external force, the algebraic
sum of the momentum after collision is numerically equal to sum of the momentum before collision.</p>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">Gravitation (g vs G) 🌍</div>

<p><b>Newton’s universal law of gravitation:</b> every particle of matter in this universe attracts every other particle with a force. This force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centers of these masses. The direction of the force acts along the line joining the masses.</p>

<div class="highlight">📌 Force between the masses is always attractive and it does not depend on the medium where they are placed.</div>

<p> <b>G (Universal Constant):</b> 6.674 x 10^-11. It never changes.</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">Acceleration</div>

<p><b>Acceleration:</b> It is the change in velocity per unit of time.</p>

<div class="formula">Formula: a = (v - u) / t       (Where a = acceleration, v = final velocity, u = initial velocity, and t = time taken).</div>

<p><b>Nature:</b> It is a Vector Quantity</p>

<p><b>Types of Acceleration:</b></p>

<p><b>Positive Acceleration:</b> When the velocity of an object increases over time (e.g., a car starting from a red light).</p>

<p><b>Negative Acceleration (Retardation/Deceleration):</b> When the velocity of an object decreases over time (e.g., a car applying brakes).</p>

<p><b>Uniform Acceleration:</b> When the velocity changes by equal amounts in equal intervals of time (e.g., an object in free fall).</p>

<p><b>Non-Uniform Acceleration:</b> When the velocity changes by unequal amounts in equal intervals of time (e.g., driving through heavy traffic).</p>

<p><b>SI Unit:</b> The standard unit is m/s^2</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">🌍 Acceleration due to Gravity (g):</div>

<p><b>Definition:</b> When an object falls towards the Earth, its velocity keeps increasing due to the Earth's gravitational pull. This rate of change in velocity is called acceleration due to the gravitational force of the Earth, or simply acceleration due to gravity.</p>

<p><b>Symbol:</b> It is represented by the letter 'g'</p>

<p><b>g (Acceleration due to gravity):</b> 9.8 m/s^2 on Earth.</p>

<p><b>Variation of 'g':</b></p>

<p>Maximum at Poles.</p>
<p>Minimum at Equator.</p>
<p>Zero at the Center of the Earth.</p>
<p>Decreases as you go higher (altitude) or deeper (depth).</p>

<div class="formula">Relation between g and G: g = (GM)/(R^2)</div>
</div>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">Mass vs. Weight ⚖️</div>

<p><b>Mass:</b> Mass is the basic property of a body. It is defined as the quantity of matter contained in the body.   It remains constant everywhere (whether on Earth, the Moon, or in outer space).</p>

<p><b>Nature:</b> It is a Scalar quantity.</p>

<p><b>Unit:</b> The SI unit is kilogram (kg).</p>

<p><b>Weight:</b> The force acting on the body is given by the product of its mass and acceleration (called as weight). Weight is the gravitational force exerted on a body due to the Earth's gravity. It is the product of an object's mass and the acceleration due to gravity.</p>

<p><b>Weight:</b> Pull of gravity on you (W = mg). It varies from one place to another because it depends on the value of acceleration due to gravity (g).</p>

<p><b>Nature:</b> It is a Vector quantity (always directed towards the center of the Earth)</p>

<div class="formula">Mass of the Earth M = g R^2/G</div>

<p><b>Moon weight:</b> Gravity is 1/6th of Earth. (If you weigh 60kg on Earth, you feel like 10kg on Moon).</p>
</div>


<div class="section">
<div class="heading">Weightlessness 👨‍🚀</div>

<p><b>Lift moving UP:</b> You feel heavier.</p>
<p><b>Lift moving DOWN:</b> You feel lighter.</p>
<p><b>Free Fall:</b> When a lift cable breaks (a = g), your apparent weight is ZERO.</p>
<p><b>Astronauts:</b> They are in a state of continuous free fall around Earth, which is why they feel weightless.</p>
